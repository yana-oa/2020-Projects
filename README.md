# 📔 Ari's Completed Projects in 2020 Repo
Welcome!

Here you can find projects that were done from mostly schoolwork and personal assignments.

# 🕹️ Types of Projects 
You'll find a lot of interactive programs. I loved game development and so most of these are python games using Pygame, interactive practice files, and Macromedia Flash games in swf that require third-party services to play (Adobe Flash is no longer supported on browsers).

It was a great start to my programming journey and these types of projects really helped me grasp the fundamentals in a memorable way.

I hope they inspire fellow coders too!
