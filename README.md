# Ari's Completed Projects in 2020 Repo
Welcome!

Here you can find projects that were done from mostly schoolwork and personal assignments.

# Types of Programs Used
Let's just say, I had a big habit of not following traditional presentation types (see my Adobe Flash games) and didn't get tbe best of grades, but hey, I'm sure they would've loved it now!

I was using Macromedia Flash 8 and Python.

You'll find interactive python games, practice files, and more.
