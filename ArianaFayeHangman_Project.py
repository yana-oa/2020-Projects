##[Game intro and Rules]
print('''[WELCOME to PYMAN !]
A game of Hangman in Python with the following rules:
-In order to win, you must guess the randomly generated word
within 7 failed attempts.
-The ways you can guess are either letter by letter or if you are
confident enough, try to guess the whole word!
-The categories of the words get more difficult with more words
With that said, have fun !
